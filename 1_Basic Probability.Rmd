## The number 1 tells tosscoin that we only want to toss the coin once. We could toss it three times
tosscoin(1)

tosscoin(3)

## We could roll a fair die
## The rolldie function defaults to a 6-sided die, but we can specify others with the nsides argument. The command rolldie(3, nsides = 4) would be used to roll a 4-sided die three times

rolldie(1)


head(cards())


# Sampling from Urns

# Ordered with replacement
urnsamples(1:3, size = 2, replace = TRUE, ordered = TRUE)

#Ordered without replacement
urnsamples(1:3, size = 2, replace = FALSE, ordered = TRUE)

#Un-Ordered without replacement
urnsamples(1:3, size = 2, replace = FALSE, ordered = FALSE)

#Un-Ordered with replacement
urnsamples(1:3, size = 2, replace = TRUE, ordered = FALSE)

```

# Events
```{r}
## Given a data frame sample/probability space S, we may extract rows using the [] operator
S <- tosscoin(2, makespace = TRUE)

S[1:3, ]

S[c(2, 4), ]

## We may also extract rows that satisfy a logical expression using the subset function, for instance

S <- cards()

subset(S, suit == "Heart")

subset(S, rank %in% 7:9)

## We could continue indefinitely

subset(rolldie(3), X1 + X2 + X3 > 16)


# Functions for Finding Subsets

## The function %in% helps to learn whether each value of one vector lies somewhere inside another vector

x <- 1:10
y <- 8:12
y %in% x


## It is more common to want to know whether the whole vector y is in x. We can do this with the isin function

isin(x, y)

## something like all(y %in% x), which would give a single result, TRUE

x <- 1:10
y <- c(3, 3, 7)

all(y %in% x)

isin(x, y)

## an optional argument ordered which tests whether the elements of y appear in x in the order in which they are appear in y

isin(x, c(3, 4, 5), ordered = TRUE)

isin(x, c(3, 5, 4), ordered = TRUE)

## A data.frame method was written for isin that simply applies the function to each row of the data frame
S <- rolldie(4)

subset(S, isin(S, c(2, 2, 6), ordered = TRUE))


# Set Union, Intersection, and Difference

S = cards()
A = subset(S, suit == "Heart")
B = subset(S, rank %in% 7:9)
##We can now do some set algebra:
union(A, B)


intersect(A, B)

setdiff(B, A)  # setdiff in not symmetric
```


# Model Assignment
```{r}
S <- cards(makespace = TRUE)
A <- subset(S, suit == "Heart")
B <- subset(S, rank %in% 7:9)

prob(A)

prob(S, suit == "Heart")

## prob(intersect(x, subset(x, event)))


# Counting Methods

## The factorial n! is computed with the command factorial(n) and the binomial coefficient (n Choose  k) with the command choose(n,k)

nsamp(n = 3, k = 2, replace = TRUE, ordered = TRUE)

nsamp(n = 3, k = 2, replace = FALSE, ordered = TRUE)

nsamp(n = 3, k = 2, replace = FALSE, ordered = FALSE)

nsamp(n = 3, k = 2, replace = TRUE, ordered = FALSE)

## Multiplication Rule
## A benefit of 'nsamp' is that it is vectorized so that entering vectors instead of numbers for n, k, replace, and ordered results in a vector of corresponding answers.

## Example: There are 11 artists who each submit a portfolio containing 7 paintings for competition in an art exhibition. Unfortunately, the gallery director only has space in the winnersâ€™ section to accommodate 12 paintings in a row equally spread over three consecutive walls. The director decides to give the first, second, and third place winners each a wall to display the work of their choice. The walls boast 31 separate lighting options apiece. How many displays are possible?
## Answer: The judges will pick 3 (ranked) winners out of 11 (with rep = FALSE, ord = TRUE). Each artist will select 4 of his/her paintings from 7 for display in a row (rep = FALSE, ord = TRUE), and lastly, each of the 3 walls has 31 lighting possibilities (rep = TRUE, ord = TRUE). These three numbers can be calculated quickly with R program

n <- c(11, 7, 31)
k <- c(3, 4, 3)
r <- c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
x <- nsamp(n, k, rep = r, ord = TRUE)

prod(x)

## alternative
(11 * 10 * 9) * (7 * 6 * 5 * 4) * 313
## or
prod(9:11) * prod(4:7) * 313

## Example: The Birthday Problem. Suppose that there are n people together in a room. Each person announces the date of his/her birthday in turn. The question is: what is the probability of at least one match?

## There is a Birthday problem item in the Probability menu of RcmdrPlugin.IPSUR
g <- Vectorize(pbirthday.ipsur)
plot(1:50, g(1:50),
xlab = "Number of people in room",
ylab = "Prob(at least one match)",
main = "The Birthday Problem")
abline(h = 0.5)
abline(v = 23, lty = 2) # dashed line

```

# Conditional Probability
```{r}
S <- rolldie(2, makespace = TRUE) # assumes ELM
head(S) # first few rows

A <- subset(S, X1 == X2)   # event A
B <- subset(S, X1 + X2 >= 8) # event B

prob(A, given = B)  # 0.2
prob(B, given = A) # 0.5
## alternative
prob(S, X1==X2, given = (X1 + X2 >= 8) ) # 0.2
prob(S, X1+X2 >= 8, given = (X1==X2) ) # 0.5


#
library(prob)
L <- cards()
M <- urnsamples(L, size = 2)
N <- probspace(M)

prob(N, all(rank == "A")) # 0.004524887


## Example: Consider an urn with 10 balls inside, 7 of which are red and 3 of which are green. Select 3 balls successively from the urn

L <- rep(c("red", "green"), times = c(7, 3))
M <- urnsamples(L, size = 3, replace = FALSE, ordered = TRUE)
N <- probspace(M)
## "red" appears 3 times
prob(N, isrep(N, "red", 3))  # 0.2916667
## What is the probability of getting two "red"s?
prob(N, isrep(N, "red", 2)) # 0.525
## What is the probability of observing "red", then "green", then "red"?
prob(N, isin(N, c("red", "green", "red"), ordered = TRUE)) # 0.175
## What is the probability of observing "red", "green", and "red", in no particular order?
prob(N, isin(N, c("red", "green", "red"))) # 0.525

## Independent events
## Example: Toss ten coins. What is the probability of observing at least one Head?
S <- tosscoin(10, makespace = TRUE)
A <- subset(S, isrep(S, vals = "T", nrep = 10))
1 - prob(A) # 0.9990234
